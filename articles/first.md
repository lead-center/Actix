The LEAD Centerâ€™s mission is to support student-centered learning and development by cultivating student leadership. We advise and engage individuals, student organizations, student government, and various campus communities to enhance the co-curricular experience at UC Berkeley.

Our values are centered on Inclusion, Equity, Sustainability, Excellence, Community, Growth, and Empowerment.

We believe leadership is the continuous process of building authentic relationships, collectively taking bold action, and practicing intentional reflection to create positive change. Our mission is to guide the learning journey of students as they explore leadership and social change in their communities. Our definition of leadership informs our leadership approach.
